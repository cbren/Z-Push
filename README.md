# Z-Push
Z-Push is an open-source application to synchronize ActiveSync compatible devices such as mobile phones, tablets and Outlook 2013 and above. With a history of almost 10 years of successful synchronization with multiple backends Z-Push is the leading open source push synchronization.

Z-Push can be easily installed using our package repositories, see the [install instructions](https://kb.kopano.io/display/ZP/Installation) for more information.

# This Fork
Most of the PHP 8 and other fixes come from [bob4os' fork](https://github.com/bob4os/Z-Push) and [umgfoin's fork](https://github.com/umgfoin/Z-Push) I've just added a few other bug fixes since, at this point, there's no central development to PR them into after Kopano's unfortunate decision to close the repos and community forums. It seems like everything is compatible with PHP 8.2.
